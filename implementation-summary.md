# LLM Lifecycle Application for Stock Market Analysis

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive application that demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a Large Language Model (LLM) for stock market OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data analysis.

The application consists of:

1. **Next.js Frontend**: A step-by-step UI that guides users through all stages of the LLM lifecycle
2. **Spring Boot Backend**: A Java backend that handles data processing, model training, evaluation, and monitoring

## Architecture

### Frontend (Next.js)

The frontend is organized around 8 main stages of the LLM lifecycle:

1. **Data Collection & Preparation**: Upload and analyze OHLC stock data
2. **Model Architecture Design**: Configure the model's transformer architecture
3. **Pre-training**: Train the model on general stock market patterns
4. **Fine-tuning**: Specialize the model for specific stock symbols
5. **Evaluation & Testing**: Quantitatively assess model performance
6. **Deployment**: Optimize the model for production use
7. **Monitoring**: Track model performance and detect drift
8. **Safety & Alignment**: Test model robustness against adversarial inputs

### Backend (Spring Boot)

The backend is structured using a standard Spring Boot architecture:

1. **Models**: Java classes representing data entities
2. **Repositories**: JPA interfaces for database access
3. **Services**: Business logic components for processing requests
4. **Controllers**: REST API endpoints for frontend communication
5. **WebSocket**: Real-time updates for training and monitoring

## Mathematical Components

Each stage incorporates mathematical techniques:

- **Data Collection**: Statistical sampling methods for balanced datasets
- **Architecture**: Linear algebra for attention mechanisms
- **Pre-training**: Gradient descent optimization for weight updates
- **Fine-tuning**: Transfer learning mathematics for domain specialization
- **Evaluation**: Statistical hypothesis testing for model comparison
- **Deployment**: Numerical methods for quantization
- **Monitoring**: Statistical process control with CUSUM charts
- **Safety**: Game theory for adversarial testing

## Setup Instructions

### Frontend Setup

1. Install Node.js and npm
2. Navigate to the frontend directory
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Access the application at http://localhost:3000

### Backend Setup

1. Install Java 11 and Maven
2. Navigate to the backend directory
3. Build the application:
   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
5. The backend API will be available at http://localhost:8080

## API Endpoints

The backend exposes the following API endpoints:

- **GET /api/status**: Check backend status
- **POST /api/data/upload**: Upload OHLC data
- **GET /api/data/{datasetId}**: Get dataset details
- **POST /api/model/design**: Create model architecture
- **POST /api/model/pretrain**: Start pre-training
- **POST /api/model/finetune**: Start fine-tuning
- **GET /api/model/training-status/{modelId}/{stage}**: Get training status
- **POST /api/model/evaluate**: Evaluate model performance
- **POST /api/model/deploy**: Deploy model
- **POST /api/monitoring/start**: Start model monitoring
- **POST /api/monitoring/stop**: Stop model monitoring
- **POST /api/model/safety**: Run safety checks

## WebSocket Endpoints

Real-time updates are available through WebSocket:

- **/topic/training-updates**: Updates during training
- **/topic/deployment-updates**: Updates during deployment
- **/topic/monitoring-updates**: Updates during monitoring

## Implementation Notes

- Both the frontend and backend are designed to demonstrate the LLM lifecycle concepts with simulated models
- The actual underlying machine learning algorithms are simulated for educational purposes
- In a production environment, integration with real ML frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch would be implemented
- The application showcases how mathematical foundations connect throughout the LLM lifecycle

## Extending for Production

To extend this for real production use:

1. Integrate with deep learning libraries for actual model training
2. Add user authentication and multi-tenancy support
3. Implement proper model versioning and artifact management
4. Enhance monitoring with more sophisticated statistical techniques
5. Add support for distributed training across multiple nodes
6. Create deployment pipelines for model updates

## Demo Data

For demonstration purposes, the application can simulate OHLC data upload with predefined stock symbols:
- AAPL (Apple)
- MSFT (Microsoft)
- GOOGL (Google)
- AMZN (Amazon)
- META (Meta/Facebook)
